# Privacy Policy: FoodieApp

__Last Update: 27 July 2023__

This privacy policy describes how we handle your information when you use FoodieApp (including the mobile app 
and website) to track your meal data. As part of our mission, your privacy matters a lot to us. By default, we 
do not collect any personal information from you. If we ever collect any personal information (for example, 
when you contact us via email), your information will not be associated with your use of FoodieApp. In all 
cases, we keep your information anonymous, even to us.

This privacy policy applies only to individuals using FoodieApp to track the food they are munching on. By 
accessing FoodieApp and its services, you agree to our privacy practices as described in this privacy policy.

## Who we are
We are FOOIDEAPP SERVICES PTY LTD, an Australian-based entity with ABN: 98 657 431 484 and business address at 
903/50 Clarence St, Sydney NSW 2000 (“FOODIEAPP LTD”, “we”, “us” or “our”). We are the provider of FoodieApp 
and are responsible for your privacy thereof. 


FoodieApp is a privacy-focused software that anonymously tracks any food data you share when using it. This 
means that from your access to the point of inputting any meal information on FoodieApp, we are unable to 
identify you.  


If you have enquiries or questions regarding the technicalities that enable us to keep you anonymous, you can 
reach out to us at contact@yourfoodie.app.  


## The types of information we collect and their uses
Our mission is to keep your use of FoodieApp private. We do not collect any information we do not need. We 
collect the following information when you access and use FoodieApp:

### Authentication Subject Identifier
To protect your information from unauthorised access, FOODIEAPP LTD uses 3rd party identity providers. That 
way, we can confirm that you are indeed you, without knowing any of your personal information. For this 
mechanism to work, we must store the Subject Identifier, a random string that is generated and managed by the 
identity provider.

You can read more about the authentication technology we use here:
- [OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
- [Subject Identifier Types](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes)
- [Implementing User Authentication with Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple)
- [One tap sign up and sign in for Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android)

### Meal description and associated metadata
In order to provide any value to you, we ask you to submit your meal description. Along with the description, 
we will collect the date and time it was made. The descriptions you provide are used to understand your eating 
habits and extract useful insights from them.

### Geo-location (IP-based)
When you use FoodieApp, we automatically obtain your approximate IP-based geo-location using Fathom analytics, 
which is also a privacy-focused third-party tool. We will use this information to provide you with optimised 
food description recognition, better app performance and meal recommendations within your country.

### Location
At some point, while you use FoodieApp, we expect to add functionality requiring a more precise location in 
order to offer, recommend and suggest meals that are closer to you. To do this, we may seek your permission to 
input your location information. If this ever comes to fruition, your location information will not be stored 
on our database for any reason. 

### Usage and performance information
We want to improve FoodieApp while you use it over time. We want to understand how FoodieApp is doing and how 
we can improve in certain areas. While you use FoodieApp, we will automatically obtain anonymous usage 
information, which may include the parts of FoodieApp you use, the features you interact with, how long you 
stay on FoodieApp or information about crashes and similar information. Since we do not want to gather any 
information about your behaviour, any usage and performance data we collect about you will not be associated 
with any personal information or identifiers associated with your profile. We have privacy-focused third-party 
tools, such as Fathom Analytics and Sentry.io for this kind of information. 

## The information we do not collect
We do not collect any information that can allow us to associate the information about the food you eat with 
who you are. We do not require you to submit your name, email address, age, home address, login credentials or 
any information other website or app owners require users to submit when they create an account. When 
unavoidable, we may receive your email address, full name and profile picture from identity providers. This 
information may be processed on your device or our server infrastructure, but it will not be stored in our 
database or associated with your FoodieApp profile.

## When we access or disclose your information
Our core mission is not to have access to or disclose any information that can identify you to a third party. 
However, some circumstances cannot be prevented. We may disclose your information in the following 
circumstances:

### To improve the efficiency of food recognition algorithms
Through FoodieApp’s interface, we will allow you to optionally opt-in to a programme aiming at improving the 
quality of our service. If you choose to become part of the programme, the food descriptions you provide us 
with may be accessed and read by our team members or contractors.

### Third-party service providers
We use third parties to provide us with cloud computing infrastructure for data analytics and storage. They 
may have access to the meal you submit to FoodieApp in order to provide their services on our behalf.

### Nutritionists or dietitians
At your request, you may decide to engage the services of a professional nutritionist or dietitian who is a 
third-party service provider on FoodiePractice, a companion app to FoodieApp. Based on such a request, we will 
disclose your meal data to such a professional to help them provide further services to you. For the avoidance 
of doubt, we will not disclose this data to such a professional unless you specifically request it or accept 
the professional’s request.

## How we secure your information
As established earlier under this privacy policy, our paramount obligation regarding your information and 
privacy is to keep you anonymous as much as possible, even to us. We do not collect personal information that 
can be used to identify who you are. A Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Encryption software protects all 
communications that go through FoodieApp. Although your meal data is not encrypted, it remains anonymous to 
other users and us.

Where we collect information about the meal you eat regularly, we will store it using industry-leading data 
storage. And if we ever collect any personal information, such as via email or based on any other 
circumstances, they will be treated separately from your use of FoodieApp. 

## The rights you have over your information
Your privacy is your right, and we will support you when you request to exercise any of your rights. In 
relation to the meal description you submit to us through FoodieApp, you have the below rights.

### Right to access your meal data
You can always access the meal description you have previously submitted to us through FoodieApp’s feed 
section. This can be done through the food registry list in the ‘Describe food’ section of the app. Learn more 
about how to use this feature on our help page. 

### Right to delete your meal data
We understand that you may want to delete your meal data or disassociate yourself from FoodieApp at some point 
due to reasons best known to you. When you intend to do so, we will gladly assist you and do it while still 
keeping you anonymous. You can request to delete your meal data or your use of FoodieApp by using the delete 
button at the bottom of your profile area. 

## How long we retain your information
We do not keep your meal data on our database for more than we need it. Upon your request to delete your meal 
data, we will delete it as soon as such a request is received. You can request the deletion of your meal data 
from FoodieApp by using the delete button at the bottom of your profile area.

## Third-party content and adverts
There may be adverts and contents that belong to third-party websites or applications in certain areas on 
FoodieApp. We are not responsible for the information you submit to these third parties when you connect to 
them through FoodieApp. These adverts and content are on FoodieApp for reference purposes and are not governed 
by this privacy policy. We advise that you consult these third parties’ privacy policies (which may be found 
on their website and/or apps) before submitting personal information to them or using their services.

## Will this privacy policy be changed?
Yes, we may review, edit or change parts of this privacy policy if it applies. Any such changes may be a 
result of changes in our practices, the features of FoodieApp or applicable privacy laws. Any changes to this 
privacy policy shall become effective upon us posting such changes, which will be reflected by changing the 
Last Update date above. Not to worry – we will notify you of any changes through a blog post on FoodieApp. If 
any changes to this privacy policy require you to submit more information, we will always notify you and ask 
for your consent within FoodieApp. However, our principle will always stand: we will always keep you anonymous.
