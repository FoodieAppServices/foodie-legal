## No waiver
If, at any point in time, we delay or refuse to enforce our rights under these Terms when you violate any part 
thereof, it shall not waive or void our right to enforce such a right at a later time or date or on similar 
violations by you. No waiver under these Terms shall be valid unless it is in writing.

## Force majeure
If, at any particular time, we delay or fail to provide FoodieApp and associated service due to circumstances 
beyond our reasonable control (such as government intervention, pandemics, internet breakdown, harmful 
software, downtimes and civil unrests), we will not be responsible for any loss or liability incurred.

## Assignment
You may not assign or transfer the rights you have under these Terms to a third party without our written 
approval. On the other hand, we may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including 
hiring the services of third-party service providers.
