# Privacy Policy: FoodiePractice

__Effective Date: 27th of July 2023__


This privacy policy applies to ‘you’, the Dietitian, Nutritionist, Personal Trainer, Naturopath or any other 
Health Professional (“Professional”, “you”, or “your”) who uses the FoodiePractice SaaS desktop app 
(“FoodiePractice”) to analyze and visualize their patients’ food data. You should read the entirety of this 
privacy policy to learn about our information collection, use, disclosure and protection practices regarding 
your use of FoodiePractice. 


As part of our mission, your privacy matters a lot to us. We do not collect personal information more than 
what we need to provide you with FoodiePractice, process your payments and comply with our legal obligations. 


By giving us consent, which may include you ticking a privacy policy consent box, you demonstrate your 
willingness for us to collect and process your information as described in this privacy policy. You should not 
use FoodiePractice if you do not consent to our privacy practices. 


## Who are we?
We are FOOIDEAPP SERVICES PTY LTD, an Australian-based entity with ABN: 98 657 431 484 and business address at 
903/50 Clarence St, Sydney NSW 2000 (“FOODIEAPP SERVICES PTY”, “we”, “us” or “our”). We are the provider of 
FoodPractice and are responsible for how the information you provide is used. 


FoodPractice is especially targeted at Professionals to help them visualize, analyze and properly track the 
food consumption data shared by their patients through FoodiePractice’s companion mobile app, the ‘FoodieApp’. 


If you have any enquiries, questions, concerns, complaints, reviews, feedback, testimonials or reports about 
our privacy practices as described in this privacy policy, please get in touch with us at name@mail.com.  


## What information do we collect?
We collect the information we need to create a profile for you, process your subscription payments, analyse 
and view your patients’ meal data and comply with applicable laws. The information we collect includes the 
following:


### Registration and profile information
We will collect the information you submit when you create an account to use FoodiePractice. This information 
may include your email address, phone number and optional information (profile picture and bio). 


### Information about your patient
We will collect the information you submit about your client, including the meal data they share with you for 
analysis purposes. However, since the users of the FoodieApp client mobile app reports their meal data 
anonymously, we are unable to identify these users when you or other Professionals share and analyse their 
meal data through FoodiePractice. You are therefore responsible for the protection of your clients’ 
identities.  


### Billing information
Since FoodiePractice runs on a subscription model, you are required to pay to analyse the meal data shared by 
your patients. Due to this, we require you to submit your billing information, which may include your name, 
address, business name and credit card details. This information will only be used by our trusted third-party 
payment processor, Stripe, to process your subscription fee. For the avoidance of doubt, we or Stripe do not 
use your billing and credit card information for any other purposes other than to process your subscription 
fee payments. You can review Stripe’s privacy policy to learn more.  


### IP Address and Geolocation information
We collect your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) Address and its geolocation (i.e., not your precise location). 
We use a third-party analytics tool, Fathom, to automatically collect this information when you access and use 
FoodiePractice. We collect this information for security purposes and to enforce our Terms of Service, 
including identifying the geographic location of your IP address so as to notify you if your account is logged 
in from a geographic location that is different from your usual geolocation or to detect if you are sharing 
your account with someone else. 


### Performance and analytics information
We collect anonymous analytics information about traffic, crashes, performance, engagements, bugs and errors 
encountered by users when using FoodiePractice. We use privacy-focused third-party tools like Sentry.io and 
Fathom for this purpose. And we use these tools because they allow us to not identify any user while we obtain 
this information.  


## How do we use the information we collect?
We use the above information we collect mainly and only for the purposes described below: 

- __Providing our services:__ The bigger picture of most information we collect is to enable us to provide you 
  with a profile and provide you with FoodiePractice to analyse your patients’ meal data.
- __Processing your payments:__ We need your billing and credit card information to enable Stripe, our third-party 
  payment processor, to process your subscription fees. 
- __Securing FoodiePractice:__ In some instances – for example, where we collect geolocation and IP Address – 
  we use your information to monitor your account and report any suspicious, unauthorised logins and accesses 
  and enforce our rights.  
- __Communicating with you:__ We collect your email address and phone number to enable us to provide support, 
  communicate with you, respond to your enquiries, send you verification codes and notify you about activities 
  involving your use of FoodiePractice.
- __Complying with the law:__ We also collect and retain certain personal information for legal purposes, 
  including where the law requires us to keep records so as to enable us to use it in cases such as claims and 
  disputes. 
- __Troubleshooting errors:__ We collect anonymous errors, crashes and bug information to identify issues and 
  errors encountered by users, which further helps us to fix these errors. 
- __Analysing website traffic:__ We also collect certain anonymous information about where people use 
  FoodiePractice from and how we can improve. 


## Who do we share your information with?
We do not directly share or transfer your personal information with or to any third party for reasons outside of the below third parties and the reasons attached: 

- __Third-party service providers:__ We use tools, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and services developed by third-party entities, which may require those entities to access personal information about you. For example, Google and Stripe help us with data storage and payment processing, respectively. The services they provide may give them access to the information you share with us. However, these third parties are trusted entities that are bound by agreements not to access information about our customers for any other purposes other than for their service performance. 
- __Law enforcement:__ If we are required by law – including in connection to a court order or legal summonses 
  – we will share personal information about you with any law enforcement, court or government agency or 
  institution. 
- __Acquiring entity:__ We may disclose information with any third-party entity that acquires, merges with, 
  consolidates with or purchases parts of our assets. This applies to any event of bankruptcy. 
- __Your clients:__ The patients who share their meal data with you via the FoodieApp mobile app will be able 
  to see your profile picture and profile information. This includes any information exchanged via videos, 
  voice and message chats.  


## How secure is your information?
Our primary obligation regarding your personal information is its safety from unauthorised access, alteration 
and use. We use Google Cloud Platform for database management, which provides us with top-level data storage 
and security. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Encryption that helps us keep all communication to and from 
FoodiePractice secure. We do not use cookies and other tracking tools to gather your use of FoodiePractice – 
meaning that we collect very little information. And we do not share personal information about you with any 
entity except those described under the circumstances above. 


However, the security of information in the digital space has its cons, and as such, we cannot guarantee that 
unauthorised third parties will not find a loophole to obtain your information, as technologies advance daily. 


## How long do we retain your information?
Our retention period depends on the information and the purpose for which we collect it. If the purpose for 
which we collect a piece of information is achieved, we take steps to delete it within 7 days. Generally, if 
you request to delete your account or certain information, we will act accordingly within 7 days – except in 
any event where applicable laws require us to retain the information for a specified period. For the meal data 
you analyse about your patients, they are deleted immediately after the patient disengages from sharing them 
with you. 


## Do we share your information across border?
Yes, we may transfer your information outside of Australia or your location to another country with variations 
in privacy laws. This is because some of our third-party service providers may be located in locations outside 
of Australia or your location. However, we ensure the third parties we transfer your information to comply 
with the 13 Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act of 1988 and any other applicable privacy laws. 


## What are your data rights?
As with any other service, you have certain rights and choices in the way we use your personal information. 
Your rights include:
- __Right to access and correct your information:__ You have the right to request access to and correct the 
  information you provide when you register a Professional account on FoodiePractice. A profile edit button or 
  link is provided to allow you to access and edit any of this information at any time you wish (this includes 
  your billing or credit card information). If you need access to and correct any other information not on 
  your profile page, please reach out to us at name@mail.com. 
- __Right to delete your information:__ Like editing your information within your profile area, you can also 
  request to have us delete your account and all of your personal information. For any information about your 
  patients’ meals, engagement and performance, which you analyse through FoodiePractice, once the client 
  disengages the share feature, the meal information will be removed from your account immediately. Please 
  note that if you delete your account and recreate a new one with the same email address and/or phone number, 
  your previous information and account will automatically be restored. 
- __Right to withdraw your consent:__ If we are processing any specific information about you based on your 
  consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. 

## Do we accept information from children?
No, FoodiePractice is for Professionals who are at least 18 years of age. If you provide us with personal 
information to use FoodiePractice, we assume that you are at least 18 years of age. If we find out you are not 
at least 18 years of age, we reserve the right to delete your account and bar you from using FoodiePractice. 


## What about third-party links?
This privacy policy does not apply to any third-party link or content that may exist in any form on 
FoodiePractice. This privacy policy applies only to the services contained within the FoodiePractice desktop 
application. If you click on any third-party link, service or advert that is not under FoodiePractice, please 
look for and read their privacy practices before submitting personal information on their platforms. 


## Will this privacy policy be modified?
Yes, we may review, edit and modify parts of this privacy policy if some of our practices change as a result 
of changes in law or features on FoodiePractice. If any modification applies, we will update this privacy 
policy and include the modification date by changing the Effective Date above. At that point, the modified 
portion becomes binding. We may notify you of changes to this privacy policy via the FoodiePractice interface 
or your email address. Nevertheless, you are advised to occasionally review this page in order not to miss any 
updates.
