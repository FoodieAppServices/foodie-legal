# FoodieApp Privacy Policy
_Effective Date: 27th of September 2021_

This privacy policy describes how we handle your data when you use FoodieApp (including the app and website). As part of our mission, your privacy matters a lot to us. By default, we do not collect any personal data from you. Where we collect personal data, we will do so with your consent, to provide you with value-adding features. In all cases, we keep your data anonymous, even to us.

This privacy policy applies only to individuals using the FoodieApp. By accessing the FoodieApp and its services, you agree to our privacy practices described in this policy. 

## The types of data we collect and their uses
Our mission is to keep your use of the FoodieApp private. We do not collect any data we do not need. We collect the following data when you access and use the FoodieApp: 

### Meal description and associated metadata
In order to provide any value to you, we ask you to submit your meal description. Along with the description, we will collect the date and time it was made.The descriptions you provide are used to understand your eating habits and extract from it useful insights.

### Geo-location (IP-based)
When you use the FoodieApp, we will automatically obtain your approximate IP-based geo-location via Geo IP databases, which shows only your country. We will use this data to provide you with optimised food description recognition and better app performance.


### Location
At some point, while you use the FoodieApp, we expect to add functionality requiring  a more precise location in order to offer, recommend and suggest meals that are closer to you. To do this, we may seek your permission to input your location data. We will not store your location data on our server. Location data will not be collected at this moment; however, we expect to collect it much later. We are using this medium to inform you to enable you to make an educated decision. 

### Usage and performance data
We want to improve the FoodieApp while you use it over time. We want to understand how the FoodieApp is doing and how we can improve in certain areas. While you use the FoodieApp, we will automatically obtain anonymous usage data, which may include the parts of the FoodieApp you use, the features you interact with, how long you stay on the FoodieApp or information about crashes and similar data. Since we do not want to gather any data about your behaviour, any usage and performance data we collect about you will not be associated with any personal data or identifiers associated with your profile. 


## The data we do not collect
We do not collect any data that can allow us to associate the data about the food you eat with who you are. We do not require you to submit your name, email address, age, home address, login credentials and other information website or app owners require users to submit when they create an account. 
When unavoidable, we may receive your email address, full name and a profile 
picture from identity providers. These data may be processed on your device or
our server infrastructure, but are never stored or associated with your profile.

Where you intend to pay for any premium features, we will not collect any payment method data nor process payments through the FoodieApp. Your payments will be handled privately through secure payment processors like Google Pay and Apple Pay. 

Where we advertise through the FoodieApp, they are not based on any data that can identify you. The adverts on the FoodieApp are based generally on our services; therefore, we do not need to collect any identifying data to place such adverts. 


## When we access or disclose your data
Our core mission is not to have access to or disclose any data that can identify you to a third party. However, some circumstances cannot be prevented. We may disclose your data in the following circumstances: 


### To improve efficiency of food recognition algorithms
Through the FoodieApp interface we will allow you to optionally opt-in to a programme aiming at improving the quality of our service. If you choose to become part of the programme, the food descriptions you provide us with may be accessed and read by our team members or contractors. 

### Third-party service providers
We use third parties to provide us with cloud computing infrastructure for data analytics and storage. They may have access to the meal you submit to the FoodieApp in order to provide their services on our behalf. 

### Nutritionists or dietitians
At your request, you may decide to engage the services of a professional nutritionist or dietitian who is a third-party service provider on the FoodieApp. Based on such a request, we will disclose your meal data to such a professional to help them provide further services to you. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not disclose this data to such a professional unless you specifically request it. 


## How we secure your data
As established earlier under this privacy policy, our paramount obligation regarding your data and privacy is to keep you anonymous as much as possible, even to us. We do not collect personal data that can be used to identify who you are. An SSL Encryption software protects all communications that go through the FoodieApp. Although your meal data is not encrypted, it remains anonymous to other users and us. 

Where we collect data about the meal you eat regularly, we will store it using industry-leading data storage.  


## The rights you have over your data
Your privacy is your right, and we will support you when you request to exercise any of your rights. In relation to the meal description you submit to us through the FoodieApp, you have certain rights. 

### Right to access your data
You can always access the meal description you have previously submitted to us through the FoodieApp. This can be done through the food registry list in the “Describe food” section of the app. Learn more how to use this feature in the F.A.Q. page here.

### Right to delete of your data 
We understand that you may want to delete your meal data or disassociate yourself from the FoodieApp at some point due to reasons best known to you. When you intend to do so, we will gladly assist you and do it while still keeping you anonymous. You can request to delete your data or your use of the FoodieApp via the delete button provided in your profile area.


## How long we retain your data
We will not keep your data on our database for more than we need it. Upon your request to delete your meal data, we will delete it as soon as such a request is received. You can request the deletion of your meal data from the FoodieApp interface. 


## Third-party content and adverts
There may be adverts and contents that belong to third-party websites or applications in certain areas on the FoodieApp. We are not responsible for the data you submit to these third parties when you connect to them through the FoodieApp. These adverts and content are on the FoodieApp for reference purposes and are not governed by this privacy policy. We advise that you consult these third parties privacy policies (which may be found on their website and/or apps) before submitting personal data to them or using their services. 


## Will this privacy policy be changed?
Yes, we may review, edit or change parts of this privacy policy if it applies. Any such changes may be as a result of changes in our practices, the features of the FoodieApp or applicable privacy laws. Any changes to this privacy policy shall become effective upon us posting such changes, which will be reflected by changing the Effective Date above. Not to worry – we will notify you of any changes through a blog post on the FoodieApp, and you can also track the history of changes via GitHub or here. If any changes to this privacy policy require you to submit more data, we will always notify you and ask for your consent within the FoodieApp. However, our principle will always stand: we will always keep you anonymous.  


## Information about us and how you can contact us
When you use the FoodieApp and provide your meal data, you are providing it to FoodieApp Services, an Australian-based business with ABN 34 206 815 436. If you use the FoodieApp from any location, you agree to the practices described in this privacy policy.

If you have any questions, concerns, complaints, feedback, ideas, suggestions or issues with the FoodieApp or this privacy policy, we are happy to help you via our Discord channel. You can leave an anonymous message on our Discord channel, which will be available via the FoodieApp.
