## Overview of Terms
This Terms of Service (these “Terms”) is an agreement between you and us (see the section below for information about us). These Terms describe the terms and conditions under which we provide the FoodieApp and associated services to you. 

You should review these Terms (along with the other documents on FoodieApp, including our Privacy Policy) and agree to them. By downloading and using the FoodieApp from the applicable app distribution store, and by accepting these Terms via the “I Agree” or “I Accept” button or box, you warrant to us that you have read and understood the entire provision and that you agree to them. 

As time goes on, we may review and update these Terms for various reasons, which may include changes to applicable laws or any of our FoodieApp features or services. Any changes to these Terms shall become effective upon us posting such changes, which will be reflected by changing the Effective Date above. Not to worry – we will notify you of any changes through a blog post on the FoodieApp, and you can also track the history of changes via GitHub or here. If you continue using the FoodieApp after we make any changes to these Terms, then we will imply that you have accepted the changes made.
